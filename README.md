## ⚙️ Work Philosophy  
I meet all client requirements, then continue refining until the system meets the production standards I trust—stable, maintainable, and built for long-term use.

I focus on projects where my expertise adds clear value and the execution can meet a high technical bar.

Automate what can be automated. Secure what needs to be protected. Keep production stable.
